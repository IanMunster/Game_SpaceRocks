# Game Maker Tutorial - SpaceRocks 
 My introduction to GameMaker Studio 2. 

**Pros:**
 1. Nice Visual Interface
 2. Many in-build Function sound similar to Unity
 3. Easy publishing to [GX Games](https://gx.games/)
	
**Cons:**
 1. No Executable Export in Trial Version
 2. GM Language is too forgiving with Syntax

## Version 1.0
 > This **GameMaker Studio 2 (GMS2)** tutorial will guide budding video game creators through the process of creating their very own fully-functional version of the definitive asteroid space blaster. Aspiring game designers can make "Space Rocks" in GMS2 using the free version without coding, by using the drag and drop technology, or by coding with GameMaker Language.
 > Designed and presented by [Friendly Cosmonaut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKCKHxkH8zqV9ltWZw0JFig), the "Space Rocks" video tutorials start out with an introduction to GMS2 before outlining how to program movement, attacking & collisions, scoring, lives, sound and effects before adding that final polish.
